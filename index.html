Congratulations Karen! Hope you have an amazing holiday and celebration. Don't worry about things at work—I've got the fort covered! (Or at least, I'll try—you know how my group is!) And remember, pace yourselves on the cruise! 🚢🍹 The drinks are endless, but your liver isn't! 😄 Enjoy every minute. Wishing you both happiness, joy, and a well-deserved break! — Nathan
